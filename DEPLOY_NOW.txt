STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT:
═════════════════════════

1️⃣  Open Google Apps Script
   → https://script.google.com
   → Find your project in the dashboard

2️⃣  Open Code.gs file in the editor

3️⃣  SELECT ALL the old code
   → Press: Ctrl + A
   → Press: Delete

4️⃣  Open YOUR LOCAL fixed file
   → File: d:\Backup app\1610\AyathanWorkflow\Appscript\Code.gs
   → Press: Ctrl + A (select all)
   → Press: Ctrl + C (copy)

5️⃣  Paste into Google Apps Script
   → Go back to the Apps Script editor tab
   → Press: Ctrl + V (paste)
   → Press: Ctrl + S (save)
   → Wait for "Saved" confirmation

6️⃣  Deploy new version
   → Click: "Deploy" button (top right)
   → Click: "Manage deployments"
   → Click: "✏️ Edit" button (pencil icon)
   → Under "Version": Select "New version"
   → Add description: "Fixed IT Lab - handlers moved to doPost"
   → Click: "Deploy"
   → Confirm it says "Version 34"

7️⃣  Test immediately
   → Go to your frontend (localhost:5173)
   → Login as HM
   → Go to "IT Lab Substitutions"
   → Click "Generate Drafts"
   → Should work now! ✅


WHY IT'S NOT WORKING NOW:
═══════════════════════════

❌ Your deployed version 33 still has the bug (handlers in doGet)
✅ Your local Code.gs file has the fix (handlers in doPost)
⚠️  Frontend is calling version 33 (the broken one)

You MUST upload the fixed code to Apps Script and deploy it!


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

After deployment, if it STILL shows "unknown action":
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Check the Apps Script version number is 34
