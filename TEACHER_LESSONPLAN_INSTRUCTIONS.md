# Teacher Instructions: Lesson Plan Preparation

## 📋 Overview
The school has enabled **Bulk-Only Mode** for lesson plan preparation. This means you must prepare **all sessions of a chapter together** instead of preparing individual sessions.

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. **Plan Ahead**
- Look at your timetable before selecting dates and periods
- Make sure you select realistic dates based on your schedule

### 2. **Be Thorough**
- All required fields must be filled for submission to work
- Provide detailed learning objectives and teaching methods
- Think about assessment strategies upfront

### 3. **Use the Calendar View**
- Select dates that align with your teaching schedule
- Avoid holidays and exam periods

### 4. **Check Your Schemes**
- Only **approved schemes** will appear in the list
- If you don't see a scheme, it hasn't been approved by the headmaster yet

### 5. **Session Sequencing**
- Sessions are taught in order (Session 1 → Session 2 → Session 3...)
- Make sure dates are in chronological order

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Clicking session number opens bulk form"
- **This is normal behavior**: Single session preparation is disabled, so clicking any session automatically opens the bulk preparation form for the entire chapter

### Problem: "Can view but not edit planned sessions"
- **This is normal behavior**: When clicking a session that already has a lesson plan, you'll see a view-only modal showing all the details. To edit, you'll need to prepare all sessions together again.

### Problem: "Scheme not found in list"
- **Solution**: Your scheme hasn't been approved yet. Contact the headmaster for approval.

### Problem: "Missing required fields"
- **Solution**: Scroll through the form and fill all fields marked with *

### Problem: Can't select a date or period
- **Solution**: 
  - Check if the date is a holiday
  - Check if you already have a lesson plan for that date/period
  - Try a different date

### Problem: Form doesn't submit
- **Solution**: 
  - Check console for errors (press F12)
  - Make sure all required fields are filled
  - Try refreshing the page and submitting again
