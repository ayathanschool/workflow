# IT Lab Support Integration - Complete âœ…

## Overview
IT Lab support has been **successfully integrated** into the existing **Substitution Management** module. There is no separate IT Lab module - everything works seamlessly within the substitution workflow.

## What's Implemented

### 1. **Automatic IT Lab Period Detection**
The system automatically identifies IT Lab periods based on subject names containing:
- "Computer"
- "IT" 
- "Information Technology"
- "Programming"
- "Coding"

### 2. **Integrated UI in Substitution Management**
When viewing substitutions, IT Lab periods are:
- **Highlighted** with a blue ring border
- **Marked** with a Monitor icon (ðŸ’»)
- **Tagged** with a blue "IT Lab" badge
- Show an additional **"IT Lab Support"** column

### 3. **IT Lab Support Assignment**
For each IT Lab period, you can:
- Select a free teacher from the dropdown
- Click the blue "Support" button with Monitor icon
- Assign IT Lab support independently of the main substitute teacher
- View assigned support teachers with a blue indicator

### 4. **Free Teachers API**
The backend `getFreeTeachers` endpoint returns all available teachers for a period, including:
- Regular teachers
- Class teachers  
- HM (Headmaster)
- All roles can be assigned as IT Lab support

**Current Test Results:**
- âœ… Returns 14 free teachers for Monday Period 2
- âœ… Includes: Ahalya, Aswani, Chandni, DK, Jubisha, Nimjusha, Priyanka, Rakhee, Ranjana Sunil (HM), Saritha, Shilpa, Test Teachers

## How to Use

### For HM (Headmaster):

1. **Navigate to Substitutions**
   - Click "Substitutions" in the sidebar menu

2. **Select Date**
   - Choose the date you want to manage

3. **View Timetable**
   - IT Lab periods will be automatically highlighted with blue indicators
   - Look for the Monitor icon (ðŸ’») and "IT Lab" badge

4. **Assign IT Lab Support**
   - In the "IT Lab Support" column, select a free teacher from the dropdown
   - Click the blue "Support" button
   - The teacher will be assigned as IT Lab support for that period

5. **Assign Regular Substitute (if needed)**
   - Use the "Substitute Teacher" column to assign the main substitute
   - This is separate from IT Lab support

6. **View Assigned Support**
   - Assigned IT Lab support teachers appear with a blue indicator
   - Shows the teacher name with a Monitor icon

## Technical Details

### Component Used
**File:** `frontend/src/components/SubstitutionModule.jsx`
**Route:** `/substitutions` in App.jsx (line 808)

### Key Features in Code

**IT Lab Detection (lines 27-35):**
```javascript
function isItLabPeriod(subject) {
  if (!subject) return false;
  const subjectLower = subject.toLowerCase();
  return subjectLower.includes('computer') || 
         subjectLower.includes('it ') || 
         subjectLower.includes('information technology') ||
         subjectLower.includes('programming') ||
         subjectLower.includes('coding');
}
```

**IT Lab Assignment (lines 257-327):**
```javascript
async function handleItLabSupportAssign(period, classname, supportTeacher) {
  // Uses special designation: absentTeacher: 'IT Lab Support'
  // Saves to substitutions with note: "IT Lab Support for {class} period {period}"
}
```

**UI Column (lines 600-650):**
- Shows dropdown for free teachers
- Blue "Support" button with Monitor icon
- Loading state during assignment
- Success/error messages

### Backend API

**Endpoint:** `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxb3eCcrPwNyzeaYZJBFPyxESd2xWnnhjt2Q_XmnH-UXGneJyGHvxCrFMCow_iNGjGp/exec`

**Action:** `getFreeTeachers`
**Method:** POST
**Body:** 
```json
{
  "action": "getFreeTeachers",
  "date": "2025-10-27",
  "period": 2
}
```

**Response:** Array of `{name, email}` objects

## Data Storage

IT Lab support assignments are stored in the substitutions sheet with:
- `absentTeacher`: "IT Lab Support" (special designation)
- `regularSubject`: "IT Lab Support"
- `substituteTeacher`: Teacher email/name
- `substituteSubject`: "IT Lab Support"
- `note`: "IT Lab Support for {class} period {period}"

This allows IT Lab support to coexist with regular substitutions without conflicts.

## Status: âœ… Complete

**All requested features are implemented and working:**
- âœ… IT Lab support integrated into Substitution Management
- âœ… Automatic detection of IT Lab periods
- âœ… Free teachers dropdown with 14+ available staff
- âœ… One-click assignment with visual feedback
- âœ… Backend API fully functional

1. Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser
2. Log in as HM
3. Navigate to Substitutions
4. Test IT Lab support assignment on any Computer/IT Lab period

## Notes

- The separate `ITLabManagement.jsx` component can be deprecated/removed as it's no longer needed

- All IT Lab functionality is consolidated in `SubstitutionModule.jsx` for a unified experience
