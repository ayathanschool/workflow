# Restore Point (Pre HM Lesson Plan Approval)
Date: 2025-12-02 10:40 IST

## Git
- Branch: `backup/hm-approval-prep-20251202-1040`
- Tag: `restore-20251202-1040`
- Main commit: b242063 (chore: pre-approval restore point backups)

## File Backups
- Appscript backup: `archive/appscript-backups/pre-approval-20251202-102733/`
- Frontend backup: `archive/frontend-backups/pre-approval-20251202-102733/`

## Rollback Steps
1. Git: `git checkout main && git reset --hard restore-20251202-1040` (or checkout the backup branch)
2. Replace modified files if needed from backup folders above.
3. Re-deploy Apps Script (use previous script version if you created one manually).
4. Re-deploy frontend (Vercel) if current deployment has issues.

## Scope of Future Changes
- Add HM Lesson Plan Approval UI (batchwise & chapterwise grouping)
- New or adjusted API consumption: `getPendingLessonPlans`, `batchUpdateLessonPlanStatus`
- No existing production logic removed; only additive components.

## Safety Notes
- Backups contain full pre-change state of `Appscript/` and `frontend/`.
- Tag ensures a permanent anchor even if branch is later deleted.

If anything breaks, follow rollback steps or ask for targeted revert commands.
